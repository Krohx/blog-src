Summary: Life log of Monday, January 4, 2016




I _first_ woke up at exactly 2AM. I think two things I did yesterday made it easy for me to wake up that early: one, I had siesta; and two, I didn't eat dinner. I have noticed you gain more control over your night time sleep when you fail to eat supper. If you must eat however, I would reckon you go with something extremely light; even a beverage should suffice.

Upon waking up, I checked Facebook, and was thrill-inspired by the status that appeared at the very top. It was by the creator of Facebook himself, Mark Zuckerberg. How inspiring it is to know that someone of that calibre still gave himself a book reading challenge -- he did so last year -- and on top of that, gave himself a new goal of building an AI for the new year -- he specifically said he'll do the coding himself, not instruct a technical team to do that.

<br/>
> "But it's a different kind of rewarding to build things yourself, so this year my personal challenge is to do that."

<br/>

I spent the next few hours cleaning up some not-yet-published scribbles and blog posts. I tried to code, but ended up just doing a little bit of reading, then returning to sleep at about 5AM.

<br />

Waking up again at about 7AM. I grabbed my breakfast pretty early, and then set off to do some much overdue laundry. That plus some other other cleaning chores took some hours.

Afterwards, I spent the rest of the day at my aunt's shop.

There, I spent some time learning about [how to test code in Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/). I learnt about __[unit testing](http://pythontesting.net/framework/unittest/unittest-introduction/)__ and __[doc testing](http://pythontesting.net/framework/doctest-introduction/#example)__, the latter being the easier one in my opinion. I also peeked into the __[twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/index.html)__ networking library which I'll need for coding my IRC bot.

Later on, I learned that it's good practice to keep "running code" (script) separate from algorithm code and data-handling code.
