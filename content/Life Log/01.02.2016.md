Summary: Life log of January 2, 2016




On the night of January 1, the previous night, while writing for _[Life Log](/category/life-log.html)_, I laid on the dinning chairs hoping to wake as soon as power was restored. For whatever reasons, it wasn't until one of my alarms went off at __5.15AM__ that I got up to realize that the power had long been supplied. At the time, my cousin, Deji was watching Sky Sports in the parlour area of the living room.

On waking up I read the bible. This is something I have not been doing consistently, however, this time, I don't intend to rush through this; so I'm taking it very slow and hopefully steady. I read thirteen verses: __Genesis 1.1-13__. These verses describe the __first three days of Creation__.

Later, I reminded myself of the plan to begin reading academic papers today.

My aunt and the rest of the family, on waking up, joined us in the living room, and we said our morning prayers.

Being a Saturday, it was only natural that we would do some sanitation. And so that followed. I did spend 'extra' amount of time cleaning and reassembling my small makeshift wardrobe (testament to cleaning obsessions).

At noon, I had my meal, and went on to spend some time on IRC while doing some other regular things I would do usually do on my computer: sort files, check code and repos on [Github](http://github.com), read code, surf the web sourcing more and more general knowledge.

While I was on IRC, **_empdokles_** (an IRC buddy) asked if we could work together on an application messaging extension for Flask. I think it's a great idea that would also require quite a bit of a learning curve. For instance, neither of us is good with Javascript, but our intended application would definitely need it, so we'd need to learn that.

In the evening, I was able to fix a small bug with my blog that was caused by conflicting options.

I am also under pressure to contribute code to my team's projects, particularly **project _jobnownow_**, which is the one we intend to get out as soon as possible. I am only trying to be consered calm and organized, as when activities are fully resumed, time would become a wilder horse to tame.

I know I still have quite a lot of things lined up. Some might be done, and some I may have to let go. Among them, four projects for my team -- one is a hospital information system management application for a client.

Then I have a Java certification examination, the OCAJP 1Z0-803 examination, which was again postponed until mid-January 2016.

Then, I have entreprenuerial and Python meetups which I signed up for last year. I also have my eyes -- but not my mind -- on the [BBC Africa's ideas workshop](http://cchubnigeria.com/blog/) scheduled for later this month at CcHub, Yaba.

There's also the [DjangoGirls web development workshop](https://djangogirls.org/lagos/) coming up. Last year as well, I signed up for this as a mentor. This one won't hold until February 2016 though.

Very recently, a co-developer acquaintance at NIIT informed me of Facebook's [app innovation challenge](https://www.internet.org/innovationchallenge) via [Internet.org](http://internet.org) for Africa.

Asides that, I have plans to code my own IRC bot. So I'm making efforts towards that as well. At the moment, I am trying to write unit tests for an open source bot, [_ekan0ra_ (aka _batul_)](http://github.com/takwas/theb0t). I also started working on this last year: [sawkat](http://github.com/takwas/sawkat). I have begun learning about the [`twisted`](https://github.com/twisted/twisted) Python library which is used for coding IRC clients and bots.

On a different note, I delayed my new year greetings messages until about 10PM yesterday. And that's when I unleashed them to their respective recipients. I'm sure the reponses would be flooding in by morning.

Past 12AM, I got to reading the introductory part of **_Roy Fielding's_** well known dissertation on software architecting, particulary because it is also widely recommended to anyone looking to fully comprehend and build [RESTful APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Prior to this, I had no idea what the typical size of an academic dissertation was; I had projected something under 20 pages.

To my disappointment, I opened Roy's work to behold a close-to-200-page work. As a result of this, I have now rethought my paper reading plan. I will no longer try to complete one paper per day. Instead, I'll spread these papers across days and try to read them through. So help me God.
