Summary: Life log of Tuesday, January 5, 2016




I woke up at 5.30AM after failing to properly wake at 2AM, ignoring my alarm earlier. Because of my intention to wake at 2AM, I had refused taking dinner yesterday, and asked that it be reserved until this morning. I guess I just couldn't help the sleepiness.

When I visited IRC yesterday, I enquired about "hacks for reading". The answer I got was a link to a [webpage](http://english.glendale.cc.ca.us/speed1.html). Visiting that page today, I found these awesome speed reading tips: 

+ Pre-scan the material, before actually reading thouroughly. Get an overview of the main points/headings/subheadings beforehand.
+ Read with intent. Once you have a grasp of the main ideas, you can read with an inquisitive mindset. Question the main points, and read as if you are searching for answers.
+ Kill the voice in your head ... and mouth! Avoid vocalization and sub-vocalization; let your brain do the work.
+ Read in word clusters (phrases), rather than word after word. This needs some getting used to, as I've seen.
+ Avoid re-reading the same phrases again. Reading should be forward ever, and almost backward never.
+ Understand that every material may not be read with the same speed. E.g newspapers can be read pretty fast, whereas technical stuff may not be read so fast, but in detail.

<br />

Surfing the net, I also found some [hair-combing tips](http://www.wikihow.com/Comb-an-Afro):

+ Mosturize the hair (dampen it with water) before combing
+ Apply a generous amount of oil (Olive oil in my case)
+ Comb gently (backwards or forwards), starting from the ends, and repeating until the roots (scalp)

I spent some time on the road today going from where I live, Bariga, to Ajah, both in Lagos State. I managed to catch some sleep on the road, and also do some reading -- I read a portion of a book I'm currently reading -- __["The Lovely Bones"](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12232938-the-lovely-bones)__.

<br />

I attended a vigil at the church tonight.
