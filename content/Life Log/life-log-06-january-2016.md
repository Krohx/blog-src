Summary: Life log of Wednesday, January 6, 2016




There hasn't  been much activity today. Since returning in the morning from the vigil I attended last night combined with an early morning church service.

<br />

My sister returned to school today. I had accompanied my aunt to drop her off at the park. On our way back from there, I alighted from the vehicle to pay a quick visit to the market, where I bought a few things before returning home.

<br />

I was pondering on the notions of _bliss_ and _nothingness_ today. The concept of "nothingness" was inspired by a "TEDcast"  -- that's _TED_ + _podcast_ :).

I feel I don't attain bliss because of my usual mood combinations: I'm usually either __excited/jovial and loud__ or __angry and extremely quiet/taciturn__. But what I desire as the perfect combo for me is __joy and quietude__.

How I wish I'd be so happy and quietly, gracefully appreciate the _art_ of life.

<br />

Another thought that came up today was that of my outward personality. I grew up thinking my own didn't appreciate me. That the strangers (some of whom have become friends) I was introduced to were the ones who loved me.

Now I realise that I am only clothed when I go out, and people simply adore my neat appearance. Back at my source called home, I am fully naked and the attitude I put up is the real me -- no makeup attached.

So if the people here (at home) have been able to put up with me until now, then I feel I should show some appreciation.


I also thought of curating a list of must learn Python modules.

I've been trying to get acquainted with testing and packaging in Python. So I have been putting some time into learning this.
