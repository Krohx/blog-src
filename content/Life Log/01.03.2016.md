Summary: Life log of Sunday, January 3, 2016



I didn't read the bible this morning, but the family had a morning devotion as usual. My sleep was a rather short one.

After the devotion, I got ready for church service. I got to the church at exactly 9AM.

I wasn't called up to interpret during the service, in fact, no youth was. The interpretion was done by one of the elders, Elder Ogunkomaya. I would think this had to do with the service being the first Sunday service for the year.

Being the first Sunday of the year, one would expect some sort of thanksgiving service. That it was, but only slightly. I guess the full package isn't until the first Sunday in February.

There were two prophecies, and one of them mentioned that, the service need not be rushed. This is worthy of note because, prior to both prophecies, the pastor had asked the prophets to keep their prophecies short.

The sermon was tagged "Unselfish Desires ...". While I particularly liked this topic, I wasn't very pleased with some of the prayers that followed. They sounded contradictory to the theme of the sermon.



In the afternoon, I had siesta. I slept off while listening to a [third TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_tells_us_why_we_love_cheat?language=en) of the afternoon. I really enjoyed [one of the talks](http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en)<sup>__[1]__</sup>, that talked about "choice". I found the talk interesting because I could easily agree with the speaker's postulations. During his presentation, the speaker, Barry Schwartz said,

> "The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations."
<br/>

I was woken from my sleep afterwards by my pastor's son, Tosin. He had been sent to fetch me. My pastor's wife and children had to return to their workstation the following, so needed some gas in their car for the trip. For this I drove out to get some petrol.

A bit delay before I got move the car out of their compound was caused by his son who had carelessly locked the only car key in vehicle. So this became the hurdle we had to face for the next 30-45 minutes. What's more: he had ignited the vehicle before locking it in, so the car was running the whole time.

Eventually, with the help of a few folks -- good thing to be a good pastor; lots of folks came around to help very quickly -- we got a metal bar into the door and removed the lock.

Over two hours later, I got the fuel, but not while I drove around searching. In fact, we had narrowly missed fuel at about three pumps, where I was told "the fuel was exhausted" just before it got to my turn.

I managed the little fuel left in the car back home, then left in a commercial tricycle headed in a different direction as the one I had previously travelled in. Surprisingly, I met a newly opened petrol station only a minute or two into the journey, happily distributing the scarce commodity to her new customers, then I joined the party.

My sister returned home from my cousins' a few minutes before I got back home. She came back with a diary and calender for me, which I very much appreciate. What I need to complete that set is a wrist-watch in a bid to have my well rounded 2016.
